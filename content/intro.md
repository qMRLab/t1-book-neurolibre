```{note}
Due to the limitation of NeuroLibre's servers and the software dependencies required to publish in NeuroLibre, this Jupyter Book does not contain the code needed to reproduce the figures. To see the full-featured Quantitative T1 MRI Jupyter Book where you can reproduce the figures on MyBinder.org's servers, please visit www.qmrlab.org/t1_book
```

This Jupyter Book is a series of interactive tutorials about quantitative T<sub>1</sub> mapping, powered by <a href="https://github.com/neuropoly/qMRLab" target="_blank">qMRLab</a>. Most figures are generated with <a href="https://plot.ly/python/" target="_blank">Plot.ly</a> â€“ you can play with them by hovering your mouse over the data, zooming in (click and drag) and out (double click), moving the sliders, and changing the drop-down options.
