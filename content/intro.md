# About

```{important}
The interactive figures within this Jupyter Book were generated by utilizing data obtained from simulations executed in MATLAB/Octave. To create a Python-exclusive runtime without the need to install Octave, we've designed this lightweight version. If you wish to run the complete Quantitative T1 MRI Jupyter Book locally and access the full source code and detailed runtime descriptions, please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/qmrlab/t1_book), which is compatible with publicly accessible BinderHub services, as of the year 2020.
```

This Jupyter Book is a series of interactive tutorials about quantitative T<sub>1</sub> mapping, powered by [qMRLab](https://qmrlab.org) {cite:p}`Karakuzu2020-ul`.

```{admonition} Interactive Figures
:class: tip

Most figures are generated using [Plotly](https://plotly.com) â€“ you can play with them by hovering your mouse over the data, zooming in (click and drag) and out (double click), moving the sliders, and changing the drop-down options.
