abstract = {The spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) is one of the fundamental parameters of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It characterizes the rate at which the longitudinal magnetization component recovers to its equilibrium state. T1 has been established as a sensitive biomarker for tissue characterization, and is also an important consideration in pulse sequence development and optimization. The development of T1 mapping techniques has been an active field of research since the early days of NMR, and a wide range of strategies have emerged for measuring T1, each with unique benefits and pitfalls. This chapter covers several strategies for measuring the T1 parameter. First, we introduce the inversion recovery (IR) T1 mapping technique. Limited by its long acquisition time, IR is widely used as a reference measure due to its high accuracy and robustness. The second section is on the variable flip angle (VFA, a.k.a. DESPOT1) technique, which leverages the steady-state signal sensitivity with respect to the excitation flip angles and T1. Capable of rapid 3D imaging, VFA is dependent on another quantitative MRI map, the radio-frequency transmit field (B1+, or B1). The third section presents a widely used dictionary-based T1 mapping technique, MP2RAGE. Boasting rapid acquisition and reconstruction times, MP2RAGE is a promising technique to get T1 maps used in the clinic. The final section presents an overview of spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T1ρ) and its acquisition techniques. T1ρ is more sensitive to molecular motion in the kHz range, and has been extensively used to study the musculoskeletal system.}
